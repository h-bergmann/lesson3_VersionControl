            <p class="lead">Version control systems keep track of changes you make to a file or set of files over a period of time so that you can go back and see what specific changes you have been making to those files. Version control systems are great for graphic designers who work in Illustrator and Photoshop and want to see every alteration they are making to an image or layout over time. VCS allows you to work on files in their previous state or even revert the entire project back to its original state. One type of VCS is a centralized VCS which allows two individuals on two different computers to share their files if they’re working on a project so they can see the changes that each other are making.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is the most widely used version control system in the world today. It is an open source project developed in 2005 by the creator of Linux. Git was designed with security, performace, and flexibility in mind. Git works well on a wide range of operating systems. Git is unlike other version control systems, instead of storing information as a list of file-based changes, it stores data in sets of snapshots in a small file system. Each time you commit the state of your project in Git, it takes a snapshot of what your files look like and stores that reference.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">You can get a Git repository using 2 different approaches. You can take an existing project and import it into Git or you can clone an existing Git repository from another server. To track an existing project you must type the command “$ git init” in the directory in order to do an initial commit. Next, to clone an existing repository, you must copy the URL into the directory, which pulls the data for that repository and pulls up a working copy of the latest version of the project. The command “$ git clone” allows you to name the repository something other than “libgit2.”

                <span class="text-muted">Basics of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Nearly every operation in Git is operated with local files and resources. This means that no data from any other computer on your network is needed. Since Git operates on local files, this means that you can work on your projects when you’re offline or off VPN. Unlike other Version Control Systems like Perforce, where you can’t work on every aspect of your project when you’re not connected to a server. There is a functionality built into Git that makes it nearly impossible to change the contents of any file with Git recording what has been changed. After you commit a snapshot of your file contents to Git, it is impossible to erase that file.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Files in your directory can be in two different states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were committed in the last screenshot which are able to be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are files in your directory that are not yet in your staging area. You can use the “$ git status README” command to see which state your files are in. Next, you can use the command “$ git add” to start tracking a new file. If you run the command over again, you see that that file is tracked and staged to the directory to be committed.
